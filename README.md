Description: Created a work day scheduler responsive app for someone who is busy and needs an online planner. User is able to store plans and update when needed by hitting the save icon, to test the storing of the app, input text in scheduler hit save btn(piggy bank) refresh the page and your plans should still display. The scheduler will display color text boxes to represent the present, past or future time(s), to help the user plan accordingly.

Installation: Created a repo in github with a README.md. Through gitbash I cloned the repo I pulled and pushed the origin master to add pages and folders in github. I added and committed meaningful changes and updated the html, css, and js code.
